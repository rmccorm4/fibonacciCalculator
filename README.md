# fibonacciCalculator
A little demonstration of just how important time complexity is in some programs such as calculating the nth fibonacci number

For example in python, just calculating the 35th fibonacci number you see a significant difference between recursion-only and memoization. At n=50, you have to wait quite a bit for the recursive function whereas the memoization function calculates just almostinstantly.
